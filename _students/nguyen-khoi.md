intro_text: |
  Hi there! I am Khoi Nguyen, an Ottawa-based Graphic Designer specializing in UI/UX, Web Design and Digital Art & Illustration. My work mostly lives in the digital space. However, I spend the majority of my time building them on paper. Most, if not all, my creative work started as notes and loose sketches in a collection of 25+ notebooks I currently have.My passion for Digital Art & Illustration started early back when I was in high school. I love to tell stories through visuals and to see them come to life through the lens of my eyes. UI/UX and Web Design became my interest later when I got into the graphic design program here at Algonquin College. Now, I am a creative who rocks both and providing creative solutions with a chance to showcase my illustration skills is ultimately what I want to do in life.

portfolio_title1: "Lyfe™ App for The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 15"
portfolio_description1: |
  The United Nations created 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as part of its ongoing agenda to call for participation to improve the future of the planet. Out of all the SDGs, I was most fascinated by Goal 15: Life on Land, which tackles the restoration of ecosystems and natural resources on land; thus, I was inspired to create a high-fidelity app prototype in response to it. This app — called Lyfe™ — is a productivity app where users can obtain coins to purchase rewards, and with a certain amount spent, real trees will be planted.
portfolio_title2: "Public Health Agency of Canada COVID Resource Centre"
portfolio_description2: |
  "The Public Health Agency of Canada provided a variety of communication methods to the general public regarding the pandemic. This includes an online resource library with newsletter/email sign up and news articles as well as infographics. This resource website, which can be found at canada.ca/public-health, has all the information that is verified from trusted sources and are up-to-date.
  The problem, however, is that the visual aspect of this resource library can make an average person overwhelmed and confused on where and what to start. This can be improved with the work of visual design and implementation of a design system. Thus, the goal of this project is to introduce graphic design combined with research and analysis to bring appeal to an informative resource centre and in turn expand public awareness regarding the current situations."
portfolio_title3: "inAn Art E-commerce Website"
portfolio_description3: |
  During the first three months of 2020, I spent time building a pattern library using HTML, CSS, and some Javascript to be used for a fictional e-commerce site branded by me called inAn. This particular project case study demonstrates how the technical and logic-based element of coding blended beautifully with the creativity and stylization of graphic design and shows how I tackle these aspects together step-by-step.
portfolio_title4: "Illustrative Playing Cards"
portfolio_description4: |
  Designing a set of playing cards where some cards only contain numbers and symbols while others feature a full-size illustration poses many challenges and tests a designer on a multitude of skills. This includes producing a strong layout & typography as well as having a sharp vision for illustrative and graphic elements. To test my creativity and design skills, I designed a set of playing cards and make them print-ready to sell in the future. The card set features characters on the court cards that belong to occupations based on the four main disciplines: Arts & Humanities, Laws & Politics, Economy, and Technology & Science. Each discipline corresponds to a suit, with an increased professional level from Jacks to Kings. The final product is a set of print-ready playing cards designed both front and back with 14 full-size character illustrations.
