intro_text: |
  Hey, I’m Quincy Prime. Unfortunately, I’m not an Autobot. Or a rack of ribs. But I am a Graphic Designer! I really enjoy motion graphics and I’m working towards moving my career in that direction. While my main passion in design is motion graphics, I also specialize in image retouching, and logo/icon design. I've also been commissioned for hundreds of social media pieces such as YouTube thumbnails and Twitch channel works.

  To be a designer is to think outside the box, turn around, and bust it open for everyone else.
