intro_text: |
  Hey, I’m Ayla and I’m a graphic designer specializing in motion design. I love being challenged with communicating an idea through compelling visuals, and getting lost in the creative process is what really sets my soul on fire. Whether it be through motion design, videography or post-production editing, I thrive from keeping things in motion.
