portfolio_title1: "Cho Choco Branding"
portfolio_description1: |
  With their growing popularity, Cho Choco's branding was outdated and in need of a new identity. The goal was to give a makeover to the initial brand and give the company a look they would be proud of, while also pleasing the clientele.
portfolio_title2: "Chicken Foodtruck"
portfolio_description2: |
   This illustration was initially done for the monthly Character Design Challenge, but was re-imagined as a potential cover for a food truck. Chickens may not fly really high or for long distances, but this one found a way to be fast and agile.
portfolio_title3: "Deodorant Packaging"
portfolio_description3: |
  The purpose of this project was to transform an environmentally harmful packaging and create a new, original template. This environmental packaging for deodorant and antiperspirant sticks offers an ergonomic and plastic free design.
portfolio_title4: "Motion Reel"
portfolio_description4: |
  This motion Reel is a brief overview of some of my animation work, done during the last two years (2019-2020).
