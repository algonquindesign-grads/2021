portfolio_title1: "Logo Redesign"
portfolio_description1: |
  New Body Dimensions Fitness Club that is located in Ottawa and was established in 1998. Their current logo is outdated and busy. I decided to create a more minimalistic logo that the audience will understand that is a gym and not something else.
portfolio_title2: "Package broadcast"
portfolio_description2: |
   I created my package broadcast for a gaming channel. I picked vibrant colours to make it fun and inviting. I added a lot of squares giving the effect of pixels like the retro video games. I had a hard time using the program but with the help of my instructor I was able to achieve my goal.
portfolio_title3: "Tinto (Branding)"
portfolio_description3: |
  The design will come in four different colours, the colours are based on the intensity of the coffee for example dark roast will be in a dark can making the customer understand right away the coffee they are about to purchaseis more intense in flavour. Why the name “Tinto” is a slang word that Colombians use to order small black coffee. The name is great way create a connection with the consumers.
portfolio_title4: "Pastel Drawing"
portfolio_description4: |
   This project shows how I can adapt and be willing to try and explore. This piece could be used in a poster for the food event of any print media.
