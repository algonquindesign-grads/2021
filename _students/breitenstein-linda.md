intro_text: |
   As an artist and graphic designer, I love to celebrate creativity. By exploring ideas, mixing mediums and techniques I have been able to transform my passion into purpose with design. I believe good design can solve problems, create connection during difficult times and bring joy to the world. I consider myself to be outgoing, a strong team member and take pride in every task I complete. When I'm not designing, I love to explore Ottawa by bike, organize game nights with friends or try out a local brewery. I need an unhealthy amount of coffee to start my day and get my best work done  early in the morning. Shout-out to my 6 AM club! I’m a firm believer in always looking for the positive in situations and growing with each step-in life.

portfolio_title1: "Hop Trails"
portfolio_description1: |
  Hop Trails is a portfolio promotion piece designed to be used as a leave behind “business card” for future employers. Tasked with creating something that makes you stand out from the other students, this beer label incorporates illustration, brand design and motion. Designed with a QR code leading to my website and an AR enabled illustration, viewers are given a snapshot of what I’m passionate about. This case study is featuring a beer label design. I wanted a creative way to entice people to view my portfolio, so this idea was born! Taking my love of craft beer to the next level and combining my love for illustration and design, Hop Trails was an obvious choice. This type of work shown here is a mix between package design, illustration and motion.
portfolio_title2: "Canadian wetlands"
portfolio_description2: |
  A wetland is a low-lying area of land covered by water long enough to support aquatic plants and wildlife for part of their life cycle. They are highly diverse, productive ecosystems that provide a host of ecological services and form an integral component of diverse landscapes. This project depicts an interactive PDF and a short animated explainer video. The content was based on the information found on the Government of Canada website. The goal is to present wetlands information in an interactive way to elementary school age children. Showing that digitally resources can be a dynamic way to engage audiences while learning about an important ecosystem. The type of work shown here is a mix of illustration, digital layout and motion design.
portfolio_title3: "Motion Reel"
portfolio_description3: |
  Over the past two years we have been learning the basics of animation principles to create emotion with motion and explore timing, pacing and dynamic storytelling. Exploring 2D, 3D and frame by frame animation, these quick clips are from some of my favourite motion design projects. This is my first motion reel and will act as a business card for my motion design skills.
