portfolio_title1: "Orleans Body Sculpture"
portfolio_description1: |
  A soft and elegant brand identity was developed for Orleans Body Sculpture  - one that is non-trendy, but timeless. A complete brand guide, stationery pieces and digital creative direction were developed to complement the new branding.
portfolio_title2: "Maison"
portfolio_description2: |
   Maison's brand identity is unified by their warm and modern aesthetic. Through HTML and CSS, their e-commerce website was developed and came to life with neutral colour tones, natural materials and warm textures just like their products.
portfolio_title3: "The Wine Garden"
portfolio_description3: |
  A vibrant & bubbly brand was designed for this wine tasting experience along with a web design that was developed to improve the event's online presence. Creative direction was also given for social media accounts and any promotional packaging.
portfolio_title4: "Annual Report"
portfolio_description4: |
  Although the world is headed in a digital direction, I believe there is still a need and love for print pieces. I am passionate about creating designs that complement a brand's aesthetic, just like this annual report.
