  A 2-month illustration made of vector brushes, shapes, and eternal patience. This piece went through many versions, but the final product was worth it! The full sized piece and how it was made is available on my website.

  With permission from the World Tea House in Halifax NS, I redesigned their logo as the center of a branding project. Using company branding practices, this new logo was created to better represent the shops business ethics.
portfolio_title3: "Dream Team Spelling Bee - Animated Short"

  A hand-drawn animation inspired by old Disney animating techniques, paying homage to some of my favourite content creators. This was a very fun project and I plan on doing more like this in the future!

  Even an average day can have unexpected results. This is a section of two receipt paper murals I created while on break as a cashier, and despite its odd beginnings it's one of my favourite illustrations. The full mural is available on my portfolio website.
