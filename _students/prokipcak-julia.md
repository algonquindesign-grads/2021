portfolio_title1: "Strawberry Blonde Bakery Re-Brand"
portfolio_description1: |
  This is a project of mine where I was challenged to remake an existing logo and brand. I reached out to Strawberry Blonde and began to research and sketch ideas to better represent their brand.
portfolio_title2: "Sustainable Temptations Packaging"
portfolio_description2: |
  Recently I have been interested in sustainability and I felt bothered by the use of plastic in pet food packaging. That inspired me to re-designed Temptations packaging to use paperboard instead.
portfolio_title3: "Beer Infographic Poster"
portfolio_description3: |
  I created this poster in 2019 based on a random theme I drew in class. I enjoyed the challenge of researching and bringing this information to life, the hardest part being fitting all the content in.
portfolio_title4: "The Gladiator Icon"
portfolio_description4: |
  In 2018 I drew the theme Maximus Decimus Meridius The Gladiator for my icon project. After several rounds of sketching and research I came up with the design that I’m still proud of.
