intro_text: |
   My name is Kyle Ellis. I am a Graphic Designer located in the Ottawa region. I specialize in business branding however, consider myself adaptable and a "Jack-of-all-trades" in the design industry.  Identity, growth and change is the reason why I am a designer. I persevere and prove to individuals I have what it takes and I will not stop working till I achieve it. Starting in a photography-driven career, my goal was to widen my horizons and build on with graphic design services. Now I believe I am a graphic designer with photography services

portfolio_title1: "Rawdon Creek Soap Co. Logo and E-Commerce Design."
portfolio_description1: |
  This project features Rawdon Creek Soap Co. A small business located in Stirling Rawdon. This collaboration piece entailed a rebrand and redesign of Rawdon Creek's website and logo. Within the first week of release, their website created a return of investment and generated extra un-tapped income. Targeting Rawdon Creeks' audience by design choices such as colour and imagery and making the website more accessible is benefiting the customer and organization with the business owners. 
portfolio_title2: "MHM & FFA Event Poster & Ticket Design"
portfolio_description2: |
   I was hired by MHM & FFA to produce an Ottawa night-out event poster and tickets. This design uses a strong type hierarchy and layout featuring the main component of the MHM logo. It is very legible and uses white space with the photography elements to engage the audience. This poster, after production, generated a sold-out event raising funds for this organization.
portfolio_title3: "AMBCANADA Logo Design"
portfolio_description3: |
  AMBCANADA is a non-profit organization of former diplomatic Canadian Heads of Mission & Ambassadors. The goal of this project is to modernize the organization’s logo and build a memorable brand. The new logo includes bilingual scripts. The new design will be applied to letterheads, websites, banners and promotional materials. AMBCANADA’s logo design represents the simplicity and accessibility of AMBCANADA. The ability of connection, leadership and voice is portrayed through this logo design.
