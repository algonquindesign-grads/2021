   Hey! My name is Kathleen Chamberland, or Kat for short. I'm a graphic designer in Ottawa, Ontario.I've always loved the thought of being a graphic designer, even from a young age; you cold find me playing around with Photoshop. When I graduated from high school I thought if this is something I like to do why not get paid for it?
