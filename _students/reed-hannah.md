intro_text: |
  Hey it's Hannah! My passions lie in Branding, Print and Illustration Design. I like to be challenged and solve problems in order to bring success to the company I am working for. I like to try new things and explore through the world of design.
  Also, Pineapples are kind of my thing!

portfolio_title1: "AmbCanada"
portfolio_description1: |
  This logo was to represent a Canadian Diplomacy Organization that was going international. They asked for 3 signature icons in the logo: a maple leaf, a bridge and a globe. They wanted a modern and simple logo.
portfolio_title2: "Cash Canuck"
portfolio_description2: |
  Cash Canuck is a small Canadian business that recently started. The client wanted Canada represented in the logo with two C's. Although that is very common and used world wide, it was a fun and creative adventure designing it.
portfolio_title3: "Sonshine's Doghouse Creations"
portfolio_description3: |
  The name of the company is not quite what the company represents. It is actually a custom pen business and he works out of a workshop he built himself. The name comes from his father and grandfather who started the business and his wife calls his workshop the “Doghouse”. It shows that I am able to overcome difficult challenges and still be able to make the client happy.
portfolio_title4: "Rawdon Creek Soap Co."
portfolio_description4: |
  I was fortunate enough to work on the re-brand and website and make the company more modernized and fresh, in order to keep their natural, organic feel. The logo is a simplified illustration of the cover bridge that is located in Rawdon. They wanted to keep their hometown apart of the brand to remember how it began.
