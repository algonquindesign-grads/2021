portfolio_title1: "Danie Design Motion Reel 2021"
portfolio_description1: |
  In this project I had to put together a motion reel of my work. I had to search for the right audio, create storyboards, animate the intro/outro and place clips.
portfolio_title2: "Festival Guide OIAF"
portfolio_description2: |
   In this project I had to create a festival guide, along with a poster on the inside. The illustration was inspired by cartoons like Ren & Stimpy, in this case I went with a tiger character.
portfolio_title3: "Event Branding Chill Fest"
portfolio_description3: |
  Here I was tasked to create an event, I went with an ice cream festival. Everything had to scream ice cream - from the illustration, logo and colors.
portfolio_title4: "Isometric Illustration Trumps America"
portfolio_description4: |
  My concept is Trumps America and what goes on in his brain. One side you have the beginning of his presidency and on the other you have the future if he is re-elected.
