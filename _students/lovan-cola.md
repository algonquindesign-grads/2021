  At the beginning of the pandemic, I sought to bring some people together to sharpen our motion graphics skills. I managed to assemble and organize 13 graphic designers for this project and delegated a Canadian province to each person. I provided the book-ends for the video and also offered my post production support. All designers are credited in the video.
